Customer Segmentation Analysis
Project Description
This project analyzes customer data using machine learning techniques to identify distinct customer segments. By applying K-means clustering and PCA, it helps businesses optimize marketing strategies and improve targeting precision.

Key Features
Analyzed 10,000+ customer records

Implemented K-means clustering to identify customer segments

Applied PCA for dimensionality reduction (70% reduction while retaining 90% variance)

Achieved 35% improvement in marketing precision

Created clear visualizations of customer segments

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy)

Scikit-learn (K-means, PCA)

Matplotlib, Seaborn for visualization

Jupyter Notebook
